# Naraka

## What
This basic game engine allow you to run a story created from Naraka Editor.

Naraka gameplay is centered around dialog which led the player to different possible walktrough and ending.

A Story is a set of step. Each step has a set of message which will be displayed before letting the player chose an answer from a list. Each answer are linked to the next Step. Moreover, step are displayed under a "mode" which set the layout of the step. For exemple, use the "sms" mode to display answer like if they are from an SMS app.

There is two working mode : SMS and Narrator.

## Why
When I think of something fun I like to fast code a concept of it. The purpose of the Naraka project was to build an engine to create and run small game, where dialog are the center of the gameplay.

## Sorry
Sorry for the "Frenchglish / Franglais" in the UI... =/
